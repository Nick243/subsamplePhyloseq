Description: This package allows for the repeated subsampling of an existing phyloseq object as described in Schloss 2023 (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.06.23.546312v1) and the averaging of common alpha- and beta-diversity metrics across the subsamples (i.e., perform rarefaction). The repeated subsampling/rarefaction provides an approach to control for uneven sequencing effort for the alpha- and beta-diversity metrics returned. A list of subsampled phyloseq objects is also returned allowing for additional metrics to be computed and averaged across the subsamples as required. Parallel computation is implemented using the doParallel and foreach packages.
